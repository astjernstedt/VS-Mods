I've wanted to learn this sort of stuff for a long time. This game peaked my interest, so I have to get into it.

Now that I've released a "functional" version of Shrub Overhaul which is a very simple config with path and file references, I realized that -

My next steps will be to learn visual studio, reading documentations and making the mod happen in professional language.
I realize that I'm a complete noob to this, so I'll be realistic in my approach and make sure to test everything thoroughly.
